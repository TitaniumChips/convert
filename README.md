# convert
A simple conversion package for Go and a test file.  

It has functions to convert MM to thousandths of an inch,  Thousandths to MM, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Fahrenheit, the radius of a circle to its circumference and area.  For most of the conversion equations I just typed in the numbers to enough digits for anything I would need at this time.

I made this for a class assignment.  It is my first attempt at making a package.
